# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to safely navigate a simulated car around a highway track. This involves safely navigating traffic and maintaining a reasonable speed by changing lanes if cars ahead are too slow. Doing this requires using sensor fusion and localization data to plan a path for the car.

## Implementation

### 1. Interpret Sensor Fusion Data
